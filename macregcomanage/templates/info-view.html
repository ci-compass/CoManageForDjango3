    <h1>NOIRLab Wireless Network Registration</h1>
    <p>Welcome to NOIRLab!
    </p>
    <p>In order to use the wireless network, the "MAC
      Address" of your computer has to be registered with the network. The
      name is historical - there is no relationship with any Apple product.
    </p>
    <p>Speaking of which, if you have a Macintosh, bring up the "System Report".
      Go to the Apple
      menu in the top left corner, select "About this Mac", and then click on
      "System Report" in the dialog that pops up. The System Report tool will
      start up. Look to the list of topics at the left edge of that window.
      Under "Network", click on "Wi-Fi". It may take several seconds for the
      tool to respond, but when it does look for the entry corresponding to
      "MAC Address". The value will consist of pairs of letters and numbers
      separated by colons (":"). Write this value down. Then enter that
      value below and click on "Submit".
    </p>
    <p>If you're using a windows machine, you should mumble mumble...
    </p>
    <p>Note that it may take an hour for your MAC Address to be pushed all the
      way out to the wireless network, and under some unusual circumstances it
            could take even longer.
